## ‚ùóÔ∏èCommon Issues and How to Fix Them

### üîê 1. Multiple Team Members ‚Äì Share Correct Apple Credentials

**Issue:**  
If your project has multiple contributors, Apple requires at least two separate accounts for App Store management.

**Solution:**
- Go to [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/account) > **Users and Access**
- Add team members with roles (e.g., Developer, App Manager)

---

### üìÉ 2. Missing Permission Descriptions

**Issue:**  
If using permissions like Camera, Location, Microphone, etc., Apple requires proper descriptions.

**Fix:**
Add to `Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses the camera to scan QR codes.</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs your location to show nearby services.</string>
```

---

### üìç 3. Handle Denied Permissions Gracefully

**Issue:**  
If users deny permissions (location, notifications), your app may crash or block access.

**Fix:**
- Always provide a fallback UI
- Example (Swift):
```swift
if CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus() == .denied {
   // Show limited view or prompt
}
```
- Let users use the app even without permissions

---

### üí≥ 4. Payment Features Must Be Highlighted

**Issue:**  
If your app involves in-app purchases or subscriptions, you must clearly explain this.

**Fix:**
- In App Store listing, explain:
  - What the user is paying for
  - Pricing structure (monthly, yearly, etc.)
- Use **Apple‚Äôs In-App Purchase system**
- Mention terms & refund policy in your UI
